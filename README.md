# OWN

Make your own websites, without a code line.

This is my application for those who want to manage their own website, as a blog or portfolio format, to share their passion with everyone!
It has an authentication system that allows the user to Register/Login and update their content and how it is openly shown.

OWN has been developed in the last 2.5weeks of my ISDI Coders full-stack development bootcamp.


## Technologies

The front-end has been built with Vue 3 & Typescript, deployed in Netlify.
The back-end has been built with ExpressJS, Typescript, Multer, MongoDB, Mongoose, jwt & firebase, deployed in Heroku.

All the app has been tested with Jest, with more than the 85% covered lines.
